Getting Started
===============

Installing
----------

Install WeaveQ using pip (you may need to ``sudo``)::

    $ pip install weaveq

Note that WeaveQ only officially supports Linux for now.

The Basics
----------

WeaveQ reads data from a set of data sources and uses information you provide
about the relationships between these data sources to perform 'pivot' or 
'join' operations.

A pivot operation selects records from one data source based on there being 
related records in a second data source, and then discards the records from 
the second data source. A join operation merges records from one data 
source into related records from a second data source. For a more detailed
explanation, see :ref:`running-queries`

As the name suggests, a data source is a WeaveQ component that retrieves data
from an external source for use in join and pivot operations. WeaveQ 
currently supports 4 data sources for use from within command line queries: 
JSON lines, JSON, CSV and Elasticsearch.

.. note::

   You can write custom data source components for WeaveQ using the WeaveQ
   API. For more details, see :ref:`overview-dev`

Configuring
-----------

WeaveQ uses a configuration file to control data source settings. Currently,
only the Elasticsearch and CSV data sources have settings that can be 
configured.

As a result, you only need to supply WeaveQ a configuration file if either:

1. You want to use Elasticsearch as a data source.
2. You don't want WeaveQ to use the first row of CSV files to determine field
   names (in the absence of a configuration file, WeaveQ defaults to doing
   this).

You must specify the configuration as a JSON file and pass it to WeaveQ using
the ``-c`` option. For example::

    $ weaveq -c /path/to/config.json -q ...

An example configuration file is shown below:

.. code-block:: none

    {
        "data_sources" :
        {
            "elasticsearch" :
            {
                "hosts" : ["10.1.1.2:9200","10.1.1.3:9200"],
                "timeout" : 10,
                "use_ssl" : false,
                "verify_certs" : false,
                "ca_certs" : "/path/to/ca/certs",
                "client_cert" : "/path/to/client/cert",
                "client_key" : "/path/to/client/key"
            }
            "csv" :
            {
                "first_row_contains_field_names" : true
            }
        }
    }

                                    the index (starting at 0) of the CSV column from which the field was
                                    read. Default = true
