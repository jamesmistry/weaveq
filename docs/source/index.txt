Welcome to WeaveQ!
==================

WeaveQ is a program and module for pivoting and joining across collections of 
data, with special support for pivoting and joining across JSON files, CSV 
files and Elasticsearch resultsets.

Using WeaveQ from the command line consists of passing a WeaveQ query string 
that specifies how to join or pivot across records from multiple data sources 
based on relationships between fields. Using WeaveQ from its Python API 
consists of specifying join and pivot behaviour programmatically and using 
custom callbacks to fetch data from data sources, optionally transform field 
values and output results. The WeaveQ query parser API can even be used to 
provide a customised textual query interface.
